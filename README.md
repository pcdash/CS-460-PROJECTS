# CS-460-PROJECTS

Operating Systems and Computer Architecture programs, created at Washington State University.
Spring Semester 2020, The Year of the Virus.

# Description
All projects from the Washington State University Operating Systems and Computer Architecture class.

# Usage
All folders should contain an executable you can run. 

```
ADD MAKE FILES TO ALL FOLDERS
```

# Help

# Required Software
Before running any programs, install the Intel x86 programs, as well as ARM packages.
```
sudo apt-get install bcc
sudo apt-get install qemu-system-i386
sudo apt-get install gcc-arm-none-eabi
sudo apt-get install qemu-system-arm
```

# Operating System
These programs rely on Ubuntu versions 15.01 to 18.04. It may be possible to run on other linux systems, but I have not tested others.

# Students
If you have found this repository because you are looking for solutions to homework, then you have succeeded and you are welcome to learn from my implementations. However, Computer Science 460, the class for which I did these assignments, requires knowledge of what the code is actually doing to pass the exit interview. If you are unable to explain where something happens, and why it does, then the professor will know, and you will be reported for plagiarism. With that being said, read my code, read the comments, understand why something happens, and then build your own implementation. Good luck on your projects!
